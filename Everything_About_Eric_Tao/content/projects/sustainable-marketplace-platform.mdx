## Problem
Enable people to exchange and donate goods with trust and transparency, supporting rich listings and conversation.

## Research
- Interviewed sellers/buyers; trust and responsiveness were top concerns.
- Mapped key flows: onboarding, list an item, contact seller, and finalize exchange.

## Build
- Frontend: React + Tailwind; product galleries with zoom.
- Backend: Firebase auth + Firestore; WebSocket chat for real-time messaging.
- Features: search/sort, seller contact, status badges for new/available.

## Results
- Real-time chat increased completed exchanges.
- Auth + scoped rules reduced spam and abuse.
