title: Mobile UI Framework
summary: UI architecture for a food exchange app with modular components and accessibility baked in.
---

## Overview
This framework was built to keep screens consistent and fast to ship. It leans on modular components, clear spacing rules, and a theming system that works across iOS and Android.

## Research Highlights
- Interviewed early adopters to map primary flows (browse, upload, chat).
- Identified accessibility gaps in color contrast and tap targets; addressed with tokens.

## Development Notes
- Component library in Figma matched to React/Tailwind implementations.
- Tokens for spacing, color, and typography drive both design and code.

## Outcomes
- Cut new-screen build time by ~40%.
- Reduced QA issues around spacing and contrast.
